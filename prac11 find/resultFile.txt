MAHARASHTRA (Marathi: Mahārāṣṭra , pronounced [məɦaːˈɾaːʂᵊʈᵊɾə], ⓘ) is a state in the western peninsular region of India occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan Plateau. It is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of Karnataka and Goa to the south, Telangana to the southeast and Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to the north, and the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the northwest.[18] MAHARASHTRA is the third-most populous state in India and the fourth-most populous country subdivision in the world.

The state is divided into 6 divisions and 36 districts. Mumbai is the capital of MAHARASHTRA due to its historical significance as a major trading port and its status as India's financial hub, housing key institutions and a diverse economy. Additionally, Mumbai's well-developed infrastructure and cultural diversity make it a suitable administrative center for the state, and the most populous urban area in India, with Nagpur serving as the winter capital.[19] The Godavari and Krishna are the state's two major rivers, and forests cover 16.47% of the state's geographical area. The state is home to six UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ajanta Caves, Ellora Caves, Elephanta Caves, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus), the Victorian Gothic and Art Deco Ensembles of Mumbai and the Western Ghats, a heritage site made up of 39 individual properties of which four are in MAHARASHTRA.[20][21]

The economy of MAHARASHTRA is the largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹42.5 trillion (US$500 billion) and GSDP per capita of ₹335,247 (US$3,900);[9] it is the single-largest contributor to India's economy, being accountable for 14% of all-India nominal GDP.[22][23][24] The service sector dominates the state's economy, accounting for 69.3% of the value of the output of the country. Although agriculture accounts for 12% of the state GDP, it employs nearly half the population of the state.
